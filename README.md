<p>My developer's institute account won't let me clone or commit to it so I am using my personal account. Problem with the SSH I believe. I'm really busy at the moment but will try to get someone to help me fix it soon. Thanks. </p>
<p>I have the word counter on the UI for fun and on the normal wordcounter file for testing. I gave up on adding eslint as it was just failing miserably and removed it.</p>
